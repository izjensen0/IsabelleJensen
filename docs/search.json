In March, he fell which gave him a concussion and rib fracture. He was out of the senate for weeks. In July, he froze for 20 seconds while addressing a press conference. He froze again in August during another press conference.\nI hypothesize that media will be harsher on McConnell and his position as a legislator when his health is in question. I did a web scrap of a politico search of “Mitch McConnell”. Then I got all the article names. I pulled titles, dates, urls, and text from the articles. I limited my pulling to only articles from 2022 to 2023. I then did a wordcloud and aggregate sentiment analysis.\n\n\n\nAlt Text"
