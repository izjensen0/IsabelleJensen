In 2023, Mitch McConnell had three public health events. In March, he fell, which gave him a concussion and rib fracture. He was out of the Senate for weeks. In July, he froze for 20 seconds while addressing a press conference. He froze again in August during another press conference. 

I hypothesize that media will be harsher on McConnell and his position as a legislator when his health is in question. 
I did a web scrape of a Politico search of "Mitch McConnell." Then I got all the article names, I pulled titles, dates, URLs, and text from the articles. I limited my pulling to only articles from 2022 to 2023. I then did a wordcloud and aggregate sentiment analysis.
